# sdsstools

![Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python->3.7-blue)

`sdsstools` provides several common tools for logging, configuration handling, version parsing, packaging, etc. It's main purpose is to consolidate some of the utilities originally found in the [python_template](https://github.com/sdss/python_template), allowing them to become dependencies that can be updated.

**This is not intended to be a catch-all repository for astronomical tools.** `sdsstools` itself aims to have minimal dependencies (i.e., mainly the Python standard library and setuptools).
