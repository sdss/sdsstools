# Changelog

## [1.9.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.9.1...1.9.2)

- Fix timezone handling in `get_sjd`.
- Fix calls to `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`.

## [1.9.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.9.0...1.9.1)

- Update `python-json-logger` to 3.2.1 to silence warnings about module deprecation.

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.8.2...1.9.0)

- Allow to define a default value for environment variables in the configuration file. If a value is defined as `${ENVAR|default_value}`, the environment variable `ENVAR` will be used if it exists, otherwise `default_value` will be used.
- Updated workflows and moved from Poetry to `uv` for dependency management.

## [1.8.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.8.1...1.8.2)

- [#52](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/pull/52) Add basic support for `GatheringTaskGroup` for Python versions 3.10 and below.

## [1.8.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.8.0...1.8.1)

- Fixed import of `GatheringTaskGroup` for Python < 3.11.

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.7.1...1.8.0)

- Added `GatheringTaskGroup` class that extends the functionality of `asyncio.TaskGroup`.

## [1.7.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.7.0...1.7.1) - 2024-07-02

- Support Numpy 2 (this only affects the `yanny` module).
- Read yanny text columns as unicode.

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.6.1...1.7.0) - 2024-06-26

- Remove `astropy` as a dependency. `yanny` will work without `astropy` except for a couple astropy-specific functions that require it, for which an exception will be raised.

## [1.6.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.6.0...1.6.1) - 2023-12-17

- Fix docstring in vendorised `yanny` module that caused warning on import.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.5.5...1.6.0) - 2023-12-13

- [#46](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/pull/46) Added several small utilities:
  - `Timer()` (already existed, but mentioning for completeness): a context manager to determine the duration of the task executed between `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
  - `get_temporary_file_path()`: returns a valid temporary named path.
  - `run_in_executor()`: simple wrapper around `asyncio` `run_in_executor` that allows to use `thread` or `process` pool executors and handles arguments and keyword arguments.
  - `cancel_task()`: cancels a task, suppressing the `CancelledError`.

## [1.5.5](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.5.4...1.5.5) - 2023-12-10

- Relax `astropy` and `numpy` requirements.

## [1.5.4](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.5.3...1.5.4) - 2023-12-10

- Fix unpickling of `Configuration` instances. This only seems relevant when trying to pass a `Configuration` object to a `multiprocessing` callback.

## [1.5.3](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.5.2...1.5.3) - 2023-12-08

- Vendorise `pydl`'s `yanny` module which can be accessed as `sdsstools.yanny`.

## [1.5.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.5.1...1.5.2) - 2023-11-30

- Allow periods in `RecursiveDict` assignments but treat them as normal dictionary keys.
- Allow retrieving keys with periods in a `RecursiveDict` if they match an existing key.

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.5.0...1.5.1) - 2023-11-30

- Fixed an issue assigning dictionaries caused by returning nested dictionaries in a `RecursiveDict` and `RecursiveDict` instances. This has been fixed by doing the conversion at assignment time. A keyword argument, `propagate_type`, allows to disable that behaviour.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.4.1...1.5.0) - 2023-11-29 [yanked]

- [#44](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/44) If `RecursiveDict` or `Configuration` return a dictionary, the dictionary is itself a `RecursiveDict` or `Configuration` object.
- [#45](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/45) Add support for Python 3.12.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.3.2...1.4.0) - 2023-11-16

- Add support for outputting log file in JSON format, via new options in `start_file_logger`.

## [1.3.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.3.1...1.3.2) - 2023-11-10

- Better typing for `RecursiveDict`.

## [1.3.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.3.0...1.3.1) - 2023-11-10

- Improved typing for `read_yaml_file`.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.2.3...1.3.0) - 2023-11-09

- [#40](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/pr/40) Additional options to `start_file_logger` for the `TimedRotatingFileHandler`.
- [#41](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/pr/41) `Configuration` now supports a recursive getter (e.g., `config['a.b.c']`).

## [1.2.3](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.2.2...1.2.3) - 2023-08-25

- Store `rich` console instance when passing it to handler.
- Simplify exception handling override code.
- Handle exceptions and log them even within IPython.
- Add option to not capture exceptions in logger.

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2) - 2023-08-25

- Ensure that logging to file happens with rich handler.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1) - 2023-08-25

- Improve logging with `rich` and do not use custon exception hook with `RichHandler`.
- Lint using `ruff`.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0) - 2023-08-21

- [#36](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/36) Add the option to use a `RichHandler` handler for console logging instead of the default `StreamHandler`. This can be enabled by passing `use_rich_handler` to `get_logger()`. For now this is not the default but it may become so in a future version.
- Update `invoke` to 2.1.3.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.0.2...1.1.0) - 2023-06-18

- [#35](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/35) Add support to reload a `Configuration`. If the configuration is based on files on disk and those have changed, the files will be read again.
- Add the option to print the time of a log message in `StreamFormatter` by doing `log.sh.formatter.print_time = True`.

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/1.0.1...1.0.2) - 2022-12-27

- **Python 3.6 and 3.7 are not supported anymore.**
- Removed the vendorised copy of `releases`. `releases` is not maintained anymore and should probably not be used. If you want to continue using it, use `0.5.4` or the normal installation of `releases`.
- Full support for Python 3.11.

## [0.5.4](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.5.3...0.5.4) - 2022-12-27

- Add `.pytest_cache` and `.nox` to directories removed by `sdss clean`.

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.5.1...0.5.2) - 2022-06-05

- Fix `get_sjd()` which used the current time instead of UTC time, and had an additional `int()` which screwed up the calculation.

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.5.0...0.5.1) - 2022-06-04

- Fix the case of YAML files with multiple environment variable substitution or in which the environment variable was not at the beginning of the string.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.4.15...0.5.0) - 2022-04-25

- Added a `time` module with a `get_sjd()` function that returns the SDSS-style Modified Julian Day for an observatory.

## [0.4.15](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.4.14...0.4.15) - 2022-04-21

- Support: allow `pid_file` or `pidfile` in `DeamonGroup` (`pid_file` is recommended since it's the one supported by `daemonocle`).
- Allow to set a global log file in `DaemonGroup` and implement log rotation.

## [0.4.10](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.4.9...0.4.10) - 2021-03-24

- Bug: force use of real path for the logger file handler path.
- Feature [#28](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/28): report base config file in `Configuration`. Clear the `Configuration` internal dictionary when `load` is called.

- Feature [#15](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/15): add a CLI wrapper to create Unix daemons.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1) - 2020-08-01

- Remove a leftover print statement in the logger.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.2.1...0.3.0) - 2020-08-01

- Support [#4](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/4): include `dev` extras in default installation.

- Bug [#8](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/8): log `StreamHandler` to `stderr` when the record level is `ERROR` or greater.
- Support [#11](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/11): replaced `colored_formatter` with a propper `Formatter` and added tests for logging.
- Support [#12](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/12): move `color_print` to `sdsstools._vendor`.

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.2.0...0.2.1) - 2020-07-30

- Store configuration file loaded in `Configuration` as `Configuration.CONFIG_FILE`.

- Feature [#5](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/5): `get_config` now returns an instance of `Configuration`, which can also be used at a lower level. `Configuration` stores the base configuration if it was specified, and can be used to load a new configuration file dynamically. Since `Configuration` subclasses from a dictionary and the functionality in `get_config` has not changed, this should be a non-breaking change.
- Support: added initial framework for tests and tests with 98% coverage for `configuration.py`.
- Support: add GitHub workflows for linting and testing.

## [0.1.12](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/compare/0.1.11...0.1.12) - 2020-07-16
